# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the problems from the Advent of Code challenge. Advent of Code is an annual coding event with daily coding challenges released every December leading up to Christmas.

I've been solving problems from the year 2015 onwards using both C++ and Python.

## Structure

- Each year has its own folder, e.g., `2015`, `2016`, etc.
- Inside each year's folder, there are subfolders for each day, named `day-01`, `day-02`, etc.
- Within each day's folder, you'll find my solutions named according to the programming language used, e.g., `part1.py`, `part2.cpp`, etc.
- Additionally, I've included input files named `input.txt` for each day.

## Languages Used

- **C++**: I've utilized C++ for some of the problems, focusing on efficiency and performance.
- **Python**: For other problems, I've opted for Python due to its readability and ease of implementation.

## Running the Code

- To run the code, navigate to the respective day's folder and execute the solution file using the appropriate command for the chosen language.
- Input data is read from `input.txt` within each day's folder. Make sure to replace it with your own input if needed.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are my own work developed for fun and learning purposes. While I strive to find optimal solutions, there might be better approaches or optimizations possible. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, suggestions, or optimizations to share!
