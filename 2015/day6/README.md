# Day 6: Probably a Fire Hazard

## Part One

You've decided to deploy one million lights in a 1000x1000 grid for a holiday house decorating contest. Santa has sent you instructions on how to display the ideal lighting configuration.

Each instruction includes whether to turn on, turn off, or toggle various inclusive ranges given as coordinate pairs. Lights are numbered from 0 to 999 in each direction.

After following the instructions, how many lights are lit?

Your answer: `377891`.

## Part Two

The light grid has individual brightness controls. Each light can have a brightness of zero or more, starting at zero.

-   `turn on` increases brightness by 1.
-   `turn off` decreases brightness by 1 (minimum 0).
-   `toggle` increases brightness by 2.

What is the total brightness of all lights combined after following Santa's instructions?

Your answer: `14110788`.
