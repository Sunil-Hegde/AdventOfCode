# Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math

## Part One

The elves need more wrapping paper and ribbon for presents. They have the dimensions (length `l`, width `w`, and height `h`) for each present.

To calculate the required wrapping paper for each gift, find the surface area of the box: `2*l*w + 2*w*h + 2*h*l`, plus the area of the smallest side.

All measurements are in feet. How much wrapping paper should they order in total?

Your answer: `1586300` square feet.


## Part Two

They're also low on ribbon. The required ribbon is the shortest distance around the sides, plus the volume for the bow.

How much ribbon should they order in total?

Your answer: `3737498` feet.
