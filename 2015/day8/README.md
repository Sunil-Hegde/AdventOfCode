# Day 8: Matchsticks

## Part One

Santa's list contains double-quoted string literals, with escape sequences for special characters like `\\`, `\"`, and `\x`. He needs to calculate the difference between the number of characters in the code representation of the string literals and the number of characters in memory for the actual string values.

The total number of characters of string code minus the number of characters in memory for all strings in the file is the answer.

Answer: `1371`.

## Part Two

Now, Santa needs to encode each code representation as a new string and find the difference between the total number of characters in the new encoded representation and the original code representation for each string literal.

The task is to find the total number of characters to represent the newly encoded strings minus the number of characters of code in each original string literal.

Answer: `2117`.
