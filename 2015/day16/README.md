# Day 16: Aunt Sue

## Part One

Given the MFCSAM's readings of specific compounds in a sample, find the number of the Aunt Sue who gave you the gift. You have a list of remembered properties for each Aunt Sue, and you need to match those properties with the MFCSAM's readings.

Your puzzle answer: `103`.

## Part Two

Some of the MFCSAM's readings indicate ranges instead of exact values. Adjust your matching process accordingly and find the number of the real Aunt Sue.

Your puzzle answer: `405`.
