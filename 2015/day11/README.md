# Day 11: Corporate Policy

## Part One

Santa needs to choose a new password based on his old one. He will increment his old password string repeatedly until it is valid according to corporate policy. The password must be exactly eight lowercase letters and meet the following criteria:
- Passwords must include one increasing straight of at least three letters, like abc, bcd, cde, and so on, up to xyz.
- Passwords may not contain the letters i, o, or l.
- Passwords must contain at least two different, non-overlapping pairs of letters, like aa, bb, or zz.

Given Santa's current password, find his next password.

Your answer: `hepxxyzz`.

## Part Two

Santa's password expired again. Find his next password after the one obtained in Part One.

Your answer: `heqaabcc`.
