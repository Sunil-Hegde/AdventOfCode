# Day 24: It Hangs in the Balance

## Part One

To balance Santa's sleigh, you need to split the packages into three groups of exactly the same weight. The goal is to find the ideal configuration with the fewest packages in the first group and the smallest quantum entanglement.

Your puzzle answer: 10439961859.

## Part Two

Santa realizes he forgot to include the trunk in the balancing process, so now you need to split the packages into four groups. Again, find the ideal configuration with the fewest packages in the first group and the smallest quantum entanglement.

Your puzzle answer: 72050269.
