# My Advent of Code 2015 Journey

Hey folks! **Sunil** here, sharing my wild ride through **Advent of Code 2015**. Get ready for the nitty-gritty!

## The Beginning

So, on **February 21, 2024**, I decided to tackle the Advent of Code 2015 challenge. Little did I know what I was getting myself into...

## The Struggle

Let me tell you, it wasn't all rainbows and unicorns. Some of these puzzles had me scratching my head for days. I mean, who knew coding could be so... puzzling?

### Learning on the Fly

I'll be honest, I had to learn a bunch of new stuff just to solve these problems. From dynamic programming to graph algorithms, I was diving into the deep end headfirst.

### Life Happens

And just when I thought I had it all figured out, life decided to throw a curveball. My laptop broke down, exams popped up, and don't even get me started on the whole fest situation. Talk about stress!

## The Victory

But you know what? Despite all the chaos, I made it through. On **May 30, 2024**, I completed all 25 challenges. It was a sweet victory, let me tell you.

## Technical Stuffff

Oh, and for my fellow techies out there, here's a peek under the hood:

- **Languages:** Python and C++ were my weapons of choice for these challenges. Python for the quick and dirty solutions, and C++ for those time-consuming programs that needed that extra juice. I also learnt a lot of basic computer science stuff like OOPs concepts, efficient data structures, some algorithms and mainly file management in both C++ and python.
- **Tools:** VS Code was my trusty sidekick throughout this journey. Couldn't have done it without you, buddy.
- **Late Nights:** Let's just say there were more than a few late-night coding sessions fueled by caffeine and determination.

## Proof of Completion

And here's the lit Advent calendar showing the proof of completion:

## Shell Script Adventures

Oh, and let me tell you about these two shell scripts:

1. [createDir.sh](https://github.com/Sunil-Hegde/AdventOfCode/blob/main/2015/idk%5CnRequired_stuff%3F/addReadme.sh) - This thing helped me create 25 folders for each day's challenge. Talk about efficiency!
2. [addReadme.sh](https://github.com/Sunil-Hegde/AdventOfCode/blob/main/2015/idk%5CnRequired_stuff%3F/createDir.sh) - Ah, the lifesaver! After realizing I forgot to add README.md files to each folder, this script came to the rescue. Phew!

2016, you are next. ðŸ˜ŽðŸš€

Hope this covers all the bases! Let me know if you need any more tweaks.
