# Day 5: Doesn't He Have Intern-Elves For This?

## Part One

Santa needs to determine which strings in his text file are naughty or nice.

For a string to be nice, it must meet the following criteria:

-   It contains at least three vowels (a, e, i, o, u).
-   It contains at least one letter that appears twice in a row.
-   It does not contain the substrings 'ab', 'cd', 'pq', or 'xy'.

How many strings are nice?

Your answer: `236`.

## Part Two

Santa changes the rules for determining nice strings:

-   It contains a pair of any two letters that appears at least twice in the string without overlapping.
-   It contains at least one letter which repeats with exactly one letter between them.

How many strings are nice under these new rules?

Your answer: `51`.
